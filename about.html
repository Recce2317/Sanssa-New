            <h1>History of SANSSA</h1>
            <hr>
            <h4>In the early days Sunday Schools in South Africa generally met for an hour on a Sunday afternoon though
                it
                later became more popular to start meeting in the morning. South Africa was considered outside the major
                ocean routes and therefore visits from Sunday school leaders of other countries rarely took place.
                Initially
                the responsibility of Sunday Schools fell under the auspices of specific denominations but due to large
                geographical regions in South Africa and the large number of different denominations all using different
                programmes, the solution lay in interdenominational co-operation.
            </h4>
            <h4>This was provided largely by SANSSA, a South African unit of the World Sunday School Association, which
                was
                started in 1915 and had its headquarters in Port Elizabeth. Membership was open to all denominations and
                Unions were established in twelve large towns, with volunteer officials except for a part time secretary
                in
                Johannesburg. The Influence of SANSSA’s work soon extended beyond the Union of South Africa’s border,
                which
                led to a merger with regions further north.
            </h4>
            <h4>SANSSA was also formed to initiate and present a nationally endorsed invitation for the World Sunday
                School
                Convention to take place in South Africa. This proposal was accepted at the 1936 Convention held in
                Oslo,
                Norway. South Africa was to host the 1940 Convention in Durban but due to the sudden start of War World
                Two,
                this was postponed indefinitely.</h4>
