                        <p>The SANSSA Teacher Training Course is a skills training course for Sunday School teachers.
                            This course has been designed to provide the specialist training required for teachers of
                            pupils in the various age categories. Upon enrolment teachers select the department group of
                            their choice and meet with that group for the duration of the course. The course is designed
                            to meet the needs of both experienced teachers and those who have just started Sunday School
                            teaching. However, experience has shown that teachers benefit most from the course when they
                            have had previous exposure to Sunday School teaching, even for a short period. A
                            certificate, issued by the respective SANSSA Regional Office, is awarded to all trainees who
                            attend at least seven out of the eight sessions.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
                        <p>The overall objective of the course is to provide Sunday School teachers with the fundamental
                            skills required to teach the Word of God to pupils at the particular age-level with whom
                            they are working.</p>

                        <h3>Time Arrangements</h3>
                        <p>The recommended time arrangement is one session per week for eight consecutive weeks.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h3>Presentation Arrangements</h3>
                        <p>The course is presented by a team of training leaders, appointed by the SANSSA Branch or
                            Region. Manuals, available to leaders, provide both content and presentation suggestions and
                            serve as guides to fulfilling the objectives of each session. Presentation is by means of a
                            variety of teaching techniques with particular emphasis on those methods which will involve
                            the trainees in meaningful learning activities. The demonstration of techniques and
                            materials and the use of real–life illustrations also form an integral part of the course.
                            Each trainee attending the course, receives a manual containing outline notes of each
                            session.</p>

                            constantly discover and develop new training leaders. The Training Leaders’ Course has been
                            designed to meet this need and should be viewed as PHASE ONE of an on-going programme of
                            training for training leaders. PHASE TWO, a follow-up to this course, will provide more
                            specific instruction in the content and procedures of the SANSSA Teacher Training Course.
                            PHASE THREE would include any refresher course-type training which may be provided for
                            registered SANSSA training leaders from time to time.</p>

                            training leaders in planning and presenting training sessions. The course also provides the
                            means whereby Branches may identify suitably-qualified training leaders whom they may invite
